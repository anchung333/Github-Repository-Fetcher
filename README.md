# Github Repository Fetcher
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

## Goals
- Build a full-stack app that takes data from GitHub's API and stores it in a database.
- Retrieve repos for a user-specified Github username and store them in a MongoDB database
- Display the top 25 repos in the server's database
- Learn how to make scoping decisions around MVP functionality, given significant time constraints
